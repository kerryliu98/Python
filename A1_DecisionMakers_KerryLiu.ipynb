    "**10 Factors that matter**\n",
    "1. Housing Type (Depending on Marriage or Parenthood)\n",
    "    - My research shows that many universities offer different types of housing for single students, students with a spouse, and students with children. Thus, I would like to offer these three types of housing in my program based on whether having a spouse or children to live with.\n",
    "    - The assignment of different types of housing should be decided separately. Only students who are applying for the same type of housing should be ranked.\n",
    "    - The output of this program should be a combination of Housing Type and Score (e.g., Single Students Housing, 15 points)\n",
    "2. Enrollment Status (Matriculated / Non-matriculated)\n",
    "    - Priority should be given to students who are enrolled in a degree program and presently seeking a degree. \n",
    "    - I will refer them as \"matriculated students\" in the rest of this assignment. \n",
    "3. Class Year \n",
    "    - I assume that the concept of \"Class Year\" is only applicable to matriculated students.\n",
    "    - Freshmen should be prioritized for being in an unfamiliar environment. \n",
    "    - Other students who are closer to graduation should have preference.\n",
    "    - Not calculated by credit completed, because the number of credits required differs from program to program. \n",
    "    - I assume that all programs are 4 years in length, and I will use a simple equation here to calculate the bonus point according to class year. \n",
    "    - If a number larger than 4 is entered, than no points will be added.\n",
    "4. Full time / Part time    \n",
    "    - Among matriculated students, those enrolled full-time should be given more priority. \n",
    "5. Academic Suspension\n",
    "    - If a student is on Academic Suspension, he or she is considered non-matriculated.\n",
    "    - Among all non-matriculated students, those who are on academic suspension due to a failure to maintain good academic standing should receive fewer points.\n",
    "6. Student source\n",
    "    - Out-of-province students and international students should be given priority. \n",
    "7. Age\n",
    "    - Senior citizens (60 or older) should have preference and receive special care. \n",
    "8. Disability (Physical or Mental)\n",
    "    - Students with disabilities should be able to choose housing that accommodates those issues.\n",
    "9. Academic Integrity\n",
    "    - Those who have never violated academic integrity should be given priority over those who have.  \n",
    "10. Conviction \n",
    "    - Those who have never been convicted of a crime should be given priority over those who have.\n",

    "When considering whether to give priority to married students and students with children, I did some research and realized that many universities offer different types of housing according to marriage and parenthood. Since a single student is not eligible for “Students with Children Housing” in the first place, there is no point to rank them together. Students eligible for different types of housing should be ranked separately. I will first ask if a student has children to live with. Students with children regardless of marriage status should apply for “Students with Children Housing”. For students without children, single students will be considered “Single Students Housing” while those with a spouse should apply for “Couples without Children Housing”. If the proportion between different types of housing is similar to the proportion between different types of students, then it can be considered fair. \n",

    "Besides, to simplify the problem, I assumed that the length of each program is 4 years. In many universities, undergraduate housing is sequentially allocated to students in their senior, junior, sophomore, and freshman year. For other universities like McGill and UBC, incoming freshmen are guaranteed student housing. Every student will go through year 1 to year 4, and somewhen they will be prioritized. In this sense, any practice is fair, because they will receive the same points all together over the four years. Still, I choose to keep a balance between these two practices, by giving the most priority to freshmen, and then those closer to graduation. There are circumstances when a student is on year 5, maybe due to reasons like academic suspension. In my program, input larger than 4 gets no score, because the principle remains that every student gets the same total points over their undergraduate studies, which is the fairest to me.\n",

    "I recognized three weaknesses for my program. First, there are often more than three types of student housing in real life scenarios. For example, single students can choose from studio, 2-bedroom apartment, town house, etc. The housing types differ from university to university. Second, some people might not feel comfortable to answer some of the questions like those concerning age and disabilities issues. Due to privacy reasons, an option of “not willing to provide answers” should be given. However, there is a conflict that if we do not know their difficulties, we cannot help them and given them extra points. Third, I imagine the major of students would have the same answer for all the questions except class year and student source. That means that most students’ score will fall into the range of 5 to 9. If the threshold falls into the same range, then this program is not enough to decide. Assume that there is 15% percent of students for each score from 5 to 9, which is a lot of students, then probably, we need to further draw lots to decide who can live in student housing. \n"
